# Accessory Tools for MAVISp-Related Research  

This repository provides accessory tools associated with papers and activities of our research group that are not part of the core **MAVISp** framework.  

## Current Tools  

- **pfam_scrape**: A tool for defining non-redundant datasets, developed for a study currently under review at *Journal of Molecular Biology (JMB)*:  
  *“Deciphering Long-Range Effects of Mutations: An Integrated Approach Using Elastic Network Models and Protein Structure Networks.”*  
- **splice_lookup.py**: is a python script designed to query the SpliceAI_lookup API (https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org) on a local server retriving the predictions about splicing alterations upon mutations from SpliceAI and Pangolin tools. developed for a study currently under review at "XXX":
  *"From Structure to Function: Interpreting the Effects of DNA Polymerase Variants in Cancer"*
