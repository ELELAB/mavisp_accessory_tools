In the folder, you can find three example cases demonstrating how to use the ArpeggioInteractionPipeline.py script.
To run each example, simply execute the run.sh command inside the corresponding folder.
Summary of contents:
full_analysis/ — contains an example showing how to run Arpeggio on all contacts in a PDB file with two chains, keeping only the residues located at the interface.
single_molecule/ — contains an example showing how to run Arpeggio on a subset of contacts (e.g., between ATP and selected residues) to identify all residues in contact with the specified molecule.
pairs_of_molecules/ — contains an example showing how to run Arpeggio on pairs of molecules (in this case, residues) to identify the contacts established between each pair.
