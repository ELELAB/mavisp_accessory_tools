BCR-ABL is associated with the uncontrolled activity of the ABL tyrosine kinase and is involved in the pathogenesis of CML and 15-30% of ALL cases.[A11377,A33432] Dasatinib also inhibits a spectrum of kinases involved in cancer, including several SRC-family kinases.[A11377]   Unlike [imatinib], another tyrosine kinase used for the treatment of CML and Ph-positive ALL, dasatinib inhibits the active and inactive conformations of the ABL kinase domain.[A2226,A11377] Also, mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL may lead to relapse during imatinib treatment. Since dasatinib does not interact with some of the residues involved in those mutations, the use of this drug represents a therapeutic alternative for patients with cancers that have developed imatinib-resistance.[A2226] The use of dasatinib was first approved by the FDA in 2006.[L45171,L45186]"

Additionally, phenol and its related compounds are used in surgical ingrown toenail treatment, a process termed phenolization.

Hydrogen peroxide is formed in the body of mammals during reduction of oxygen either directly in a two-electron transfer reaction [L2024]. As a natural product of metabolism, it readily undergoes decomposition by catalase in normal cells [L2024].   Due to its potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial actions, hydrogen peroxide is used in both liquid and gas form for preservative, disinfection and sterilization applications as an oxidative biocide [A32369]. It is used in industrial and cosmetic applications as a bleaching agent. Hydrogen peroxide is also considered as a generally recognized as safe compound by the FDA [L2024]; it is used as an antimicrobial agent in starch and cheese products, and as an oxidizing and reducing agent in products containing dried eggs, dried egg whites, and dried egg yolks."

It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,[A229698] which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis.[A7450] Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevents abnormal blood cell proliferation.[A229708] Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed.[A229938]  Ruxolitinib was first approved for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis by the FDA in 2011, followed by EMA's approval in 2012.[A229708] In 2014, it was approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of [hydroxyurea] and in 2019, ruxolitinib was approved for use in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adults and children.[L31958] The topical formulation of ruxolitinib is used to treat atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.[L39125] It is being investigated for other inflammatory skin conditions.[A229883]  Ruxolitinib has been investigated to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by severe systemic hyperinflammation. In phase II clinical trials, ruxolitinib improved chest computed tomography and improved recovery in patients with lymphopenia.[A229713, A229718] However, phase III clinical trials later determined that ruxolitinib was inadequate in meeting its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications [L31968] thus the drug was not approved as a treatment for COVID-19."
